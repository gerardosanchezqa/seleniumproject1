# seleniumproject1

Project started from live Selenium testing project on Guru99: https://www.guru99.com/live-selenium-project.html

Implementing practices like:
- Base test case to manage webdriver creation and quitting
- Page object model
- Page factory
- Preventing the use of the webdriver in the test themselves by narrowing access of the driver to page objects and their actions 
- Parameterized data either from hardcoded object data or reading from Excel file
